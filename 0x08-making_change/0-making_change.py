    Change comes from within‚Äù project, you will tackle a classic problem from
    the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the coin change
    problem. The objective is to find the minimum number of coins required
    to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations
    This project challenges you to apply your understanding of algorithms
    to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient.
    Below are the key concepts and resources necessary to complete
    this project successfully
